    "1. *Get the full chat history in order to see al relevant analysis performed*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **challenges:** \n",
    "\n",
    "    - If chat gets summarized, previous analysis are blurred out. We need detailed history, but at the same time we cannot input more than a certain number of tokens to the model that produces the analysis. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    **solutions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - we need to keep the full chat state somewhere when we summarize. Maybe store it in state. Could be a long `analysis` str, or could be a virtual file in the virtual file system. Then the `write_report()` tool could split the full history in sections in order not to exceed context length.     \n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Collect all sources used - meaning, the list of all datasets analized*\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We have to keep track of all used datasets.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **solutions:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Just add a state var `sources`; it gets filled every time we **select** a dataset with the `select_dataset` tool. The model that writes the report can then cite the source throughout the report, understanding when it was used from chat history.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Produce an extensive report (.md format probably)*\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "> **? Should the report include python code ?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> It could be useful to include in the report - or somewhere else - all python code written during the analysis. \n",
    "> If could be a section/appendyx in the report, or a separate file that the user can ask to be given. \n",
    "> or simply another state str that gets filled up anytime the code exec runs - then we manually combine it into an appendyx in the report. i Just don't want it to be like 3000 lines at the end of the report. maybe they should be separate files. \n",
